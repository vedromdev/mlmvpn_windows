// --- Which copy of a core to run: the store's verified install, or the one the app shipped ---
//
// «ام‌ال‌ام استور» never writes into the app's own core/ directory, for two measured reasons:
//
//   * the PORTABLE build unpacks itself into a fresh temp directory on every launch, so a core
//     replaced in place is silently back to the old one the next time the app starts;
//   * the INSTALLED build keeps core/ under app.asar.unpacked in Program Files, which an upgrade
//     wipes — and a half-replaced executable there is a broken engine with nothing to roll back to.
//
// So every store install is its own directory — %ProgramData%\MLM VPN\store\cores\<id>\<version>\
// on Windows, /Library/Application Support/MLM VPN/store/cores/<id>/<version>/ on macOS — and this
// file decides, per start, whether an engine runs from there or from core/. A running
// engine is never touched: the new version is picked up the next time that engine starts, and the
// old directory stays until nothing needs it.
//
// THE RULES, and why each exists:
//
//   * A store install is used only when it is NEWER than what this build ships (store/shipped.js).
//     An app upgrade that brings a newer core must beat an older store install, not be shadowed by
//     it.
//   * The recorded directory must sit inside the store root, and every recorded file must still be
//     there at its recorded size. active.json is data; a record that points elsewhere, or a file
//     that has changed since it was verified, sends the engine back to core/.
//   * Nothing here executes anything or touches the network. It runs on the connect path, in
//     Electron's main thread — a few stat calls and a cached JSON read, nothing more.
//
// The directory itself is created with an ACL that lets only SYSTEM and Administrators write
// (store/cores.js › protectRoot). That matters more than any check here: these binaries are run by
// an elevated app, so a folder an ordinary user could write to would be a privilege escalation.
//
// MLMVPN_STORE_DISABLE=1 ignores the store entirely — the escape hatch for "is it the new core?".

/**
 * A path to a file this build SHIPS — the one thing every engine needs and six of them got wrong.
 *
 * In the packaged app, `__dirname` is inside `app.asar`, and `core/` is not: electron-builder
 * unpacks it to `app.asar.unpacked/core/` because **Windows cannot execute a file inside an
 * archive**. So `path.join(__dirname, 'core', 'x.exe')` names a path that does not exist, and
 * spawning it fails with ENOENT.
 *
 * It is invisible during development, and that is why it shipped: from source, and in the
 * asar-to-folder test build (dev-unpack.js), `__dirname` is an ordinary directory with `core/`
 * right there, so the wrong path is the right path. Only the installer exposes it.
 *
 * 2026-09-22: that is exactly how «لنترن» closed the whole application on a user's machine —
 *   spawn C:\Program Files\MLM VPN\resources\app.asar\core\lantern.exe ENOENT
 * with سایفون, تور, وارپ, اوپن‌وی‌پی‌ان and گیت‌وی all one click from the same crash.
 *
 * Use this instead of building the path by hand. The test in tests/aether/packaging.test.js
 * fails the build if a manager goes back to a raw `__dirname`.
 *
 * On macOS there is no asar-unpack problem — Electron can exec a file inside app.asar on Darwin —
 * but the `unpacked` rewrite is harmless there and keeps one code path for both platforms.
