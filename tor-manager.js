/**
 * The «تور» engine: tor itself, plus lyrebird as its pluggable transport.
 *
 * Ported from the Android app's `TorManager.kt`, and deliberately a port rather than a fresh
 * design — every number in here came out of a measurement on a real Iranian line, and the two
 * platforms disagreeing about which transport to try first would mean one of them is wrong.
 *
 * ## What runs
 *
 *   TUN ─► sing-box ─► tor SocksPort 20820 ─► circuit
 *                 └─ DNS ─► tor DNSPort 20821
 *                           tor ─► lyrebird.exe (a managed PT, for the bridge rungs)
 *
 * `core/tor/tor.exe` is 0.4.9.12 and `core/tor/pluggable_transports/lyrebird.exe` is 0.8.1 —
 * the Tor Project's own Windows Expert Bundle 15.0.22, verified against their signed
 * `sha256sums-signed-build.txt`. lyrebird serves obfs4, meek_lite, snowflake and webtunnel from
 * the one executable, so there is exactly one PT process whichever bridge rung is running.
 *
 * ## No UDP, and that is not a limitation to work around
 *
 * Tor carries TCP only. So the tunnel is built with `supportsUdp: false`, QUIC is refused rather
 * than dropped (so browsers fall back to TCP at once instead of waiting out a timeout), and DNS
 * goes to tor's own `DNSPort` on loopback — NOT to a public resolver. That last one is a privacy
 * decision, not a plumbing one: a public resolver in the list would send every app's lookups
 * outside the circuit in cleartext, naming exactly which sites a user who just turned Tor on is
 * visiting.

 *  - `TOR_PT_EXIT_ON_STDIN_CLOSE=1` makes lyrebird exit when we do. Without it, killing the app
 *    can leave an orphan PT holding its listener and the next connect cannot bind.
 *  - `TOR_PT_STATE_LOCATION` must end in a separator; lyrebird writes its obfs4 bridge state there.
 *  - `TOR_PT_PROXY` is the ONLY way a bridge rung can join an outer tunnel. With `UseBridges 1`
 *    it is the PT, not tor, that makes the real outbound connection — and putting `Socks5Proxy`
 *    in the torrc instead makes tor refuse to start. Measured on Android: with the variable set,
 *    all 75 of meek's CDN dials crossed the proxy and tor bootstrapped in 36s; without it, 0
 *    crossed.
 *
 * Resolves true only when the transport actually registered a listener. A live process that
 * registered nothing is a failure: it would leave tor with a `ClientTransportPlugin` line
 * pointing nowhere.

 * The obvious feature was the one every other engine in this app has: race the candidates, keep
 * the fastest. Tor even makes it easy — `IsolateSOCKSAuth` means N probes under N usernames get N
 * independent circuits, `circuit-status` names the exit each one used, and `SETCONF ExitNodes`
 * pins the winners. It was built, and it was measured against itself three times in a row,
 * alternating so that line drift could not explain the result:
 *
 * ```
 *                 single stream      four streams
 *   unpinned        7.33 Mbit/s       5.96 Mbit/s
 *   pinned          3.21 Mbit/s       2.19 Mbit/s
 * ```
 *
 * Pinning the three fastest exits made Tor **two and a half times slower**, on both measures, in
 * every round. Two reasons, and both are worth keeping written down:
 *
 *  1. Tor already weights its path selection by relay bandwidth across some two thousand exits.
 *     Narrowing that to three does not select quality, it concentrates load — every circuit the
 *     machine builds then queues behind the same three relays.
 *  2. The measurement the pin was built on was not measuring what it claimed. A brand-new Tor
 *     circuit begins in slow start, so a few hundred kilobytes through a freshly built probe
 *     circuit reads its ramp-up, not its capacity. Settled circuits in the same minute measured
 *     9.6 and 10.4 Mbit/s while the "fastest" probe read 3.9.
 *
 * And the exit is not the variable anyway. Two consecutive draws landed on the SAME exit relay —
 * `F3Netze` — and measured 4.57 and 2.33 Mbit/s, with time-to-first-byte of 557 ms and 4180 ms.
 * What varies is the whole circuit and the load on it at that moment, which no list of favourites
 * can predict.
 *
 * ## What is here instead
 *
 * The one lever the measurements do support: the draw itself. Settled paths on this line ranged
 * from 0.99 to 10.4 Mbit/s with nothing chosen differently between them — so a slow Tor is very
 * often one bad draw away from a fast one, and `NEWNYM` is free. So: measure the real path, and
 * if it is poor, ask for another and measure that. No constraint on tor's own choice, nothing
 * pinned, and every number in the report is a settled path rather than a ramp-up.
 *
 * It stops at the first draw that clears the bar, which means the common case — a path that is
 * already fine — costs one short measurement and changes nothing.
 */

/**
 * The bar, in megabits, for "this path is fine, leave it alone".
 *
 * Measured across nine consecutive settled draws on this line, one stream each:
 *
 *     0   0.27   1.14   3.12   3.88   5.41   6.13   7.58   9.24        median 3.88
 *
 * Nothing was chosen differently between any of them. One draw carried nothing at all, two more
 * were under a megabit, and the best carried nine — which is the whole case for re-drawing. The
 * bar sits below the median on purpose: high enough to reject the bottom third, low enough that a
 * line which genuinely cannot do better is not made to chase itself for ever.
 */
const GOOD_MBIT = 2.5;

/**
 * The floor between two NEWNYM signals — a floor, not a sleep.
 *
 * Tor coalesces signals inside a ten-second window, so two draws closer together than that would
 * measure the same circuit twice and report it as two independent draws. But the measurement
 * itself already takes about six seconds, and sleeping the full eleven on top of it wasted
 * twenty-two seconds of a forty-nine-second run. Only the remainder is waited for.

/**
 * ONE STREAM, NOT SEVERAL — and for Tor that is the right shape, unlike every other engine here.
 *
 * سایفون and گف are measured with six parallel streams because their per-connection ceiling is
 * far below what the line can carry, so one stream badly understates ordinary browsing. Tor is
 * the opposite: every stream in one isolation group is multiplexed onto ONE circuit, so parallel
 * streams contend with each other instead of adding up. Measured over nine draws, four streams
 * read at or below a single stream on the same circuit in half of them — 1.87 against 7.58 in the
 * worst case, purely from contention.
 *
 * The warm-up is not politeness, it is correctness: a brand-new Tor circuit begins in slow start,
 * so the first few hundred kilobytes read its ramp-up rather than its capacity.

 * The circuit the user's own traffic is on, identified rather than guessed.
 *
 * `liveInfo` picks the newest BUILT general-purpose circuit, which is a reasonable guess and was
 * wrong often enough to matter: tor pre-builds circuits, so the newest one is frequently a spare
 * that nothing is attached to. Measured that way, five consecutive draws reported the same exit
 * relay while their throughput ranged from 0 to 9.24 Mbit/s — the attribution, not the network,
 * was constant.
 *
 * So the circuit is asked for by holding a real connection open: a SOCKS stream to the probe host
 * with nothing sent down it, whose circuit id is then looked up in `circuit-status` for the path.
 * It costs one connection and no data.
 *
 * THE STREAM IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS EVENT, not by its target. The obvious way — read `stream-status`
 * and find the row whose target is the probe host — silently never matches, because by the time a
 * stream is SUCCEEDED tor has rewritten its target to the address the exit resolved:
 *
 *     12 SUCCEEDED 9 162.159.140.220:80          <- not «speed.cloudflare.com:80»

/**
 * How old tor's picture of the network is.
 *
 * ## The theory this was built on, and what measuring it showed
 *
 * Tor cannot build a circuit until it knows which relays exist, and that knowledge expires — so
 * the obvious explanation for «سرعت اتصال پایین» was a stale directory, and the obvious fix was a
 * background refresh that pays the download before the user asks for a connection. Both were
 * built. Then they were measured:
 *
 * ```
 *   consensus 37 HOURS past its validity, microdescriptors 8 days old   ->  17 s
 *   fresh consensus                                                     ->   7-10 s
 *   nothing cached at all (a first connect on a new machine)            ->   minutes
 * ```
 *
 * A stale directory costs about ten seconds, not minutes: tor keeps every microdescriptor it has
 * and only fetches what changed. So the refresh was removed — it would have spent a user's data
 * every few hours to save them ten seconds, which on a metered Iranian line is a bad trade made
 * on an untested assumption.
 *
 * The one case that IS slow is the first connect on a machine with no cache, and no amount of
 * warming helps there: the same megabytes have to come down either way. What that case needs is
 * to be SAID, which is what this is read for — see [startTor].
